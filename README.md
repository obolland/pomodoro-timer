Use the up and down buttons to select session length (amount of time you wish the primary timer to count down from) and break length (the amount of time you wish the secondary timer to count down from).

Press 'Start' to begin the timer. When the timer reaches 0 an alarm will sound notifying you that the timer has reached 0 and it's time to take a break or return to work.

Use 'Reset' to reset the timer to it's default values
